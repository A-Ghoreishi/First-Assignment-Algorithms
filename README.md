# First Assignment Warm-Up 📚

Welcome to your second assignment in the Advanced Programming course! This repository contains three medium to somewhat hard problems. The main goal of this assignment is to help you learn more advanced parts of Java syntax and put your problem-solving skills to the test.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with the assignments, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. Complete the tasks given in each assignment. The details and requirements for each assignment can be found as a comment block within their respective methods.

4. Once you have completed an assignment, commit your changes using the following commands:

   ```
   git add . or git add -A
   git commit -m "Completed Assignment <number>"
   ```

6. Push your changes to the remote repository using the following command:

   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

8. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to create an issue in the repository or reach out to your mentor. 🤝

## Prerequisites ✅

- Basic knowledge of Java
  - Although it is not necessary to know in order to solve the problems, I advise you to also read about `Map<>` in Java and use them in your solutions.
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub basics.
