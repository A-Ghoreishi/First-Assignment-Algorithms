# Second Assignment Algorithms  📚

Welcome to your second assignment in the Advanced Programming course! This repository contains three medium to somewhat hard problems. The main goal of this assignment is to help you learn more advanced parts of Java syntax and put your problem-solving skills to the test.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with the assignments, follow the steps below:

1. Fork this repository and clone the fork to your local machine using the following command:
   
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. Complete the tasks given in each assignment. The details and requirements for each assignment can be found as a comment block within their respective methods.

4. Once you have completed an assignment, commit your changes using the following commands:

   ```
   git add . or git add -A
   git commit -m "Completed Assignment <number>"
   ```

6. Push your changes to the remote repository using the following command:

   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

8. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to create an issue in the repository or reach out to your mentor. 🤝

## Prerequisites ✅

Before attempting this assignment, make sure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of Java
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub basics.

## Evaluation 📃

To successfully complete this assignment, you need to meet the following requirements:

1. Ensure your code compiles and runs without any errors.
2. Pass all the unit tests provided in the `src/test/java` directory.
3. Organize your code in a clear and readable manner. Use proper indentation and follow clean code principles.
4. Add comments to explain your code and make it easier to understand.

Remember to use Git for version control throughout the assignment. Commit your changes frequently and provide meaningful commit messages to track your progress.

**Note: It is strictly prohibited to use ChatGPT or any other AI generative model for completing any section of this assignment. Failure to comply will result in a score of 0 without any warnings.**

## Notes 📝

- Although it is not necessary to know in order to solve the problems, I advise you to also read about `Map<>` & `HashMap<>` in Java and use them in your solutions.
- It's worth mentioning you are free to use ChatGPT or any other AI generative model in order to learn topics that you can not find suitable resources for on the internet such as `Map<>` & `HashMap<>`.
